- add a pkg-config thingy
- go through the rest of this todo and remove stuff that's done

- ability to completely disjoin result sets
- prepared statements!
- table introspection
- add binding by index, mass-field functions by index
- more sanity checking in get and get_idx functions
- revamp error handling
- tweak print DSSSL to shade ProgramListing content
- plugins:
	* msql
	* oracle
	* ODBC ?
	* others?
- finish plugin author's guide
- determine datatype information (how many bits an 'int' is, etc. mainly for portability to non-lintel systems)

int -> long, ulonglong portable?
create result without row count, -1 for rowcount accessors
_get_field_info -> query, not firstrow
