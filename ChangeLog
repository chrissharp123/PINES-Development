	* do not use TRUNCATE when refreshing
	  reporter.materialized_simple_record
	  
	  Previous behavior would break Slony replication after doing a
	  bib load. Since a deletion is slower than a truncate, if you're
	  not using Slony replication, you may prefer to truncate rmsr
	  prior to calling
	  reporter.enable_materialized_simple_record_trigger.

	* asset.uri needs a seed entry for queries of its ID values
	  
	  To fix a problem with ingesting URIs, Ingest.pm was changed to
	  reflect
	  the maximum asset.uri.id value rather than the
	  asset.call_number.id
	  value. However, with no entries in asset.uri, the query returned
	  a
	  NULL object which broke ingest entirely. Adding a seed entry
	  avoids
	  this problem.
