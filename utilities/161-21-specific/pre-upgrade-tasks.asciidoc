Pre-Upgrade 1.6.1 to 2.1 Tasks
------------------------------
These are the steps required of us to upgrade PINES from Evergreen 1.6.1.8 to Evergreen 2.1.0.  These are focused almost entirely on the database upgrade, which requires a new version of PostgreSQL.

.Summary of full process:
. Do some database cleanup and backups.
. Export the database using the pg_dump utility.
. Import the database into PostgreSQL 9.1.
. Run the modified 1.6.1-2.0-upgrade-script.
. Run the (possibly modified) 2.0-2.1-upgrade-script.
. Do some post-upgrade cleanup.
