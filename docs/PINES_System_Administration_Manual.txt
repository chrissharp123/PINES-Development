PINES System Administration
---------------------------

PINES History
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Georgia PINES Library program began in 1999 as a Y2K initiative for Georgia public libraries who did not have the resources to replace their non-Y2K-compliant library automation systems.  It evolved into an opportunity to create a statewide public library system where a patron could check out books all across the state with a single library card.

Evergreen
~~~~~~~~~
Evergreen was developed by GPLS specifically for the PINES Program.

The PINES Hardware Environment
------------------------------

[[LegacySetup]]
Legacy Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The original Evergreen developers designed the PINES cluster to be robust, which means that there is a great deal of load balancing, failover, and redundancy at nearly all levels.

[[LVS]]
Linux Virtual Server (LVS) Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
PINES employs the Linux Virtual Server (http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/) to receive and redirect all HTTP/HTTPS traffic from the web to the application bricks. 

[[AppBricks]]
Application "Bricks"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The application layer is managed by server "bricks".  A brick consists of a head server, which runs Apache, and 2 or more drone servers that run the OpenSRF processes.  In PINES, the connection between the head and the drones is established via the Network File Server (NFS) program.

[[DBs]]
Database Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
PINES uses four servers running PostgreSQL.

[[Memcache]]
Memcache Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Memcache is centrally managed on two redundant servers.

[[Content]]
Added Content Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Added content was managed separately pre-1.6 (April 2011).

[[SIP]]
SIP2 Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The SIP2 servers provide an interface for third-party circulation and computer management products.

[[Utility]]
The Utility Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The utility server provides a number of auxiliary functions that are necessary to the system.

[[Logger]]
Logger Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The logger servers record all of the system's activity and may be used to track down system problems or to track user activity.
